  To study calculus, you need a strong foundation in several areas of mathematics. These areas are often covered in a course known as precalculus or advanced algebra. Here are the main areas you should focus on:

1. **Algebra**: This includes understanding of functions, polynomials, and their properties. You should also be comfortable with operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division [Source 1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3079871/what-are-the-prerequisites-for-calculus).

2. **Trigonometry**: Understanding of trigonometric functions and their graphs is crucial. You should be familiar with the basic trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent, as well as their inverse functions [Source 1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3079871/what-are-the-prerequisites-for-calculus).

3. **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**: These functions are used extensively in calculus. You should understand how to manipulate these functions and how they relate to each other [Source 1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3079871/what-are-the-prerequisites-for-calculus).

4. **Limits**: While not always necessary to cover in a precalculus course, understanding limits is foundational to calculus. Limits are used to define derivatives and integrals [Source 1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3079871/what-are-the-prerequisites-for-calculus).

In terms of calculus itself, the main topics you'll need to study include:

1. **Derivatives**: This involves studying rates of change, slopes of tangent lines to curves, and applications of derivatives.

2. **Integrals**: This involves studying accumulation of quantities, area under curves, and applications of integrals.

3. **Differential Equations**: This involves solving equations that involve derivatives.

4. **Sequences and Series**: This involves studying infinite sequences and series, and their properties.

5. **Vector Calculus**: This involves studying differentiation and integration of vector fields.

6. **Multivariable Calculus**: This involves extending the concepts of calculus to functions of several variables [Source 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calculus_topics), [Source 17](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus).

Remember, it's important to understand the concepts behind these topics, rather than just memorizing formulas. Using resources such as textbooks, online courses, and practice problems can help you develop a strong understanding of these topics [Source 1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3079871/what-are-the-prerequisites-for-calculus), [Source 2](https://math.cornell.edu/first-year-calculus), [Source 7](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-001-calculus-fall-2023/pages/textbook/), [Source 10](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/11971/requirements-to-learn-calculus), [Source 15](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/classroom/classes/CalculusI.html), [Source 17](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus), [Source 22](https://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/1-introduction).
