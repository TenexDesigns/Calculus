While it's true that calculus is heavily rooted in algebra, trigonometry plays a significant role in calculus as well, especially in more advanced topics. Here are some reasons why trigonometry is important in calculus:

1. **Trigonometric Functions**: Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent are used extensively in calculus. For instance, the derivatives and integrals of these functions are fundamental to understanding the behavior of these functions and to solving problems involving these functions in calculus [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

2. **Trigonometric Identities**: Trigonometric identities are used in various proofs and simplifications in calculus. For example, understanding trigonometric identities can help you make manipulations in calculus that are necessary for progress in the subject [Source 3](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/17146/how-important-is-knowledge-of-trig-identities-for-use-in-calculus).

3. **Trigonometric Substitution**: This method is used in integration to simplify the integral. It often provides vastly simpler integrands as compared to their more complicated partners. The simplification and rationale can be derived from the trigonometric identities [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

4. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Trigonometric transformations are used in calculus to transform coordinates from Cartesian to polar. This is particularly useful in geometric proofs and in the study of complex numbers [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

5. **Periodic Behavior**: Trigonometric functions are used to model periodic behavior which is widespread throughout science, engineering, and the humanities. Understanding trigonometry is essential to understand key ideas in calculus [Source 3](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/17146/how-important-is-knowledge-of-trig-identities-for-use-in-calculus).

6. **Practical Applications**: Trigonometry is incredibly useful for many practical applications such as navigation, surveying land for construction projects, calculating distances between two points on a map or globe, or predicting tidal patterns or oceanic currents. These applications often involve complex equations involving circles or curved lines which can be solved using trigonometry [Source 0](https://mathodics.com/why-is-trigonometry-so-important/).

While it's true that calculus is 95% algebra, the other 5% is often trigonometry. Therefore, having a good understanding of trigonometry is important for success in calculus. However, the specific amount of trigonometry you need to know depends on the specific topics in calculus you are studying.
