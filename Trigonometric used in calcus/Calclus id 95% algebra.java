It's true that a significant portion of calculus involves algebraic manipulations, and proficiency in algebra is crucial for success in calculus. However, trigonometry is an integral part of calculus, and a good understanding of trigonometric concepts can enhance your ability to work with certain functions and solve problems more efficiently.

While it's correct that many calculus problems involve algebraic techniques, certain topics within calculus heavily rely on trigonometric functions. Here are some examples:

1. **Trigonometric Limits and Continuity:**
   - Understanding the behavior of trigonometric functions as they approach certain values is crucial for evaluating limits and ensuring continuity.

2. **Derivatives and Integrals Involving Trigonometric Functions:**
   - Derivatives and integrals of trigonometric functions often require knowledge of trigonometric identities and the application of specific rules.

3. **Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations:**
   - Describing curves in polar coordinates and parametric equations involves trigonometric functions.

4. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions in Integration:**
   - Integrating functions containing trigonometric expressions often requires the use of inverse trigonometric functions.

5. **Trigonometric Substitution:**
   - In certain integration problems, trigonometric substitution is a powerful technique to simplify expressions and find antiderivatives.

While its true that you might not need to memorize every trigonometric identity or formula, having a solid foundation in the basics of trigonometry can significantly ease your understanding of the calculus concepts mentioned above. You don't necessarily need to be an expert in every aspect of trigonometry, but having a working knowledge of key trigonometric functions and identities will be beneficial.

If you find trigonometry challenging, consider focusing on the specific trigonometric concepts that are most relevant to the calculus topics you're studying. Practice problems that integrate trigonometric functions, work with polar coordinates, or involve parametric equations. This targeted approach can help you build the necessary skills for calculus without feeling overwhelmed by the entire breadth of trigonometry.

Its true that algebra plays a major role in calculus, forming the foundation for its concepts and calculations. While I wouldn't say 95% is completely accurate, it's safe to say that a strong understanding of algebra is key to excelling in calculus. However, completely dismissing trigonometry as unnecessary for calculus wouldn't be entirely accurate either. Here's a more nuanced breakdown:

**Algebra's Importance in Calculus:**

* **Manipulating Expressions:** Calculus heavily involves manipulating expressions with variables, constants, and various functions. Algebraic skills like factoring, simplifying, and applying the order of operations are essential for solving problems.
* **Differentiation and Integration:** These core principles of calculus rely heavily on understanding and applying algebraic rules for differentiating and integrating various functions, including polynomials, rational functions, and exponential functions.
* **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Many calculus problems involve setting up equations, manipulating them algebraically, and solving for unknowns. Strong algebraic skills allow you to navigate these steps efficiently and accurately.

**Where Trigonometry Comes In:**

While not as foundational as algebra, trigonometry still plays a significant role in calculus in several ways:

* **Trigonometric Functions:** Calculus explores the behavior of various functions, including trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent. Understanding their derivatives, integrals, and properties is crucial for solving certain problems.
* **Applications:** Many real-world problems involving motion, waves, and periodic phenomena rely on trigonometric concepts and calculations. Calculus tools are often used to analyze these situations, requiring an understanding of both subjects.
* **Polar Coordinates:** Some areas of calculus, like parametric equations and complex analysis, delve into polar coordinates, where trigonometric functions are essential for defining points and performing operations.

**Precalcus as a Bridge:**

Precalcus acts as a bridge between algebra and calculus, introducing students to trigonometric functions, their graphs, and identities. Using concepts like sine instead of x in precalcus prepares students for encountering and handling trigonometric functions within calculus equations and problems.

**Overall:**

* **Strong algebra foundation is crucial for calculus.**
* **Trigonometry plays a supportive role, though not as extensive as algebra.**
* **Understanding trigonometric functions, their properties, and basic applications is beneficial for calculus.**
* **Precalcus prepares students for using trigonometric concepts in calculus.**

So, while focusing on strengthening your algebra skills is definitely a wise strategy for tackling calculus, don't neglect trigonometry entirely. A basic understanding of its key concepts and their relevance in calculus will prove valuable as you progress. Remember, it's about finding the right balance between focusing on essential skills while not overlooking concepts that can further support your learning journey.

  While it's true that calculus is heavily rooted in algebra, trigonometry plays a significant role in calculus as well, especially in more advanced topics. Here are some reasons why trigonometry is important in calculus:

1. **Trigonometric Functions**: Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent are used extensively in calculus. For instance, the derivatives and integrals of these functions are fundamental to understanding the behavior of these functions and to solving problems involving these functions in calculus [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

2. **Trigonometric Identities**: Trigonometric identities are used in various proofs and simplifications in calculus. For example, understanding trigonometric identities can help you make manipulations in calculus that are necessary for progress in the subject [Source 3](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/17146/how-important-is-knowledge-of-trig-identities-for-use-in-calculus).

3. **Trigonometric Substitution**: This method is used in integration to simplify the integral. It often provides vastly simpler integrands as compared to their more complicated partners. The simplification and rationale can be derived from the trigonometric identities [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

4. **Trigonometric Transformations**: Trigonometric transformations are used in calculus to transform coordinates from Cartesian to polar. This is particularly useful in geometric proofs and in the study of complex numbers [Source 4](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1040039/why-is-trigonometry-important-in-calculus).

5. **Periodic Behavior**: Trigonometric functions are used to model periodic behavior which is widespread throughout science, engineering, and the humanities. Understanding trigonometry is essential to understand key ideas in calculus [Source 3](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/17146/how-important-is-knowledge-of-trig-identities-for-use-in-calculus).

6. **Practical Applications**: Trigonometry is incredibly useful for many practical applications such as navigation, surveying land for construction projects, calculating distances between two points on a map or globe, or predicting tidal patterns or oceanic currents. These applications often involve complex equations involving circles or curved lines which can be solved using trigonometry [Source 0](https://mathodics.com/why-is-trigonometry-so-important/).

While it's true that calculus is 95% algebra, the other 5% is often trigonometry. Therefore, having a good understanding of trigonometry is important for success in calculus. However, the specific amount of trigonometry you need to know depends on the specific topics in calculus you are studying.
